 *
 * \brief Class def header for a class UbooneNoiseFilter
 *
 * This filter is a comprehensive noise filter for Microboone.
 *
 * It is optimized for speed and designed to leave signals intact
 * while removing noise waveforms.  In particular it does:
 *   - On the fly, wire by wire pedestal subtraction
 *   - Harmonic Noise removal on a plane by plane basis
 *   - Correlated noise removal on a service board by service board basis
 *     -- This subtraction uses 3 plane information and so should affect
 *        tracks that are parallel to the time ticks in a single plane.
 *
 * To do this algorithm quickly, and with flexibility, it goes over the data
 * in multiple passes.  First, it must pedestal subtract each wire or the other
 * noise effects can not be cleanly removed.  In this stage, wires are also
 * classified as one of the following:
 *   kNormal   - no observed issues with the wire
 *   kLowRMS   - the wire has lower than expected RMS, indicating problems
 *   kHighRMS  - the wire has higher than expected RMS
 *   kChirping - the wire is observed to be in a chirping state
 *
 * For chirping wires, the waveform that is chirping is zeroed while the
 * rest of the waveform is kept in tact.
 *
 * Next, it determines the noise waveforms for the correlated noise.  Since
 * this involves a median across a set of ticks, which are not quite in consecutive
 * memory, this part of the algorithm is the slowest.
 *
 * While it is possible (and faster) to subtract the correlated noise waveforms
 * from the ticks on the fly, this is not done.  Instead we remove the harmonic
 * noise component from the correlated noise, and then build a correlated noise
 * waveform across the planes.
 *
 * Finally, the harmonic noise and the correlated noise are subtracted from the
 * waveforms, and the filtering can return.
 *
 * While this class doesn't save the noise waveforms, pedestals, etc, it does
 * provide access to these metrics for a calling class to save if desired.
